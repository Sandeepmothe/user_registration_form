# 🧾 User Registration Form with GoREST API Integration

This project is a simple and responsive user registration form built using **HTML**, **CSS (Bootstrap)**, and **JavaScript**. It demonstrates form validation, real-time user feedback, and API interaction using the [GoREST API](https://gorest.co.in/).

## 🔧 JavaScript DOM Features

In this project, I practiced **DOM manipulation** using JavaScript to make the webpage interactive.

### ✅ What I Implemented:

- Used `getElementById`, `addEventListener`, and DOM properties to capture input values.
- Dynamically updated the DOM to show validation error messages.
- Trimmed user input to remove unwanted white spaces.
- Validated:
  - Empty name and email fields
- Displayed:
  - “Required*” message for empty fields
  - “Email Already Exists, Invalid Email” message from API
- Handled form submission using `fetch()` with POST request to GoREST API.
- Conditional rendering based on API response codes (422 for errors, 201 for success).
